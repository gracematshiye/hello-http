# hello-http

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

# How to run it:

Finally, run the web application. Go to the hello-http directory which holds the project.clj file.

$ lein run

Now, the web server has started running. Open your favorite web browser and go to:

http://localhost:3000


## Now you can run it like this, reload the webpage:
$ lein ring server

	-------------------------------
Once the web server starts up, the web page pops up and shows the words in the core2.clj.

Change the words in core2.clj and reload the page on the browser. You’ll see the change is reloaded.
